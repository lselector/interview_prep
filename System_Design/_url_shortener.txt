TinyURL offers an API which allows applications 
to automatically create short URLs. 
This is done by simply reading the result returned 
from tinyurl.com/api-create.php?url=URLENCODED_SOURCE_URL.

Convert:
  http://levselector.com
into
  https://tinyurl.com/y74lpq94
or into custom alias:
  http://tinyurl.com/KindleWireless

There are 100+ similar services, for example:
  bit.ly, goo.gl, qlink.me, etc.

With time the length of random unique key grows.
(tinyurl grew from 6 to 8)

API:
  URL --> tiny_url     (generate and store tiny_url)
  tiny_URL -> redirect to real URL

Architecture:
  load balancer, 
  workers to generate tiny_url
  service to provide range counters to workers
  save URL into database
  clone database around the globe for fast access (CDN idea)
      (create URL may be slow, but using it should be very fast)
  cache for database
