Hello!

I am so excited to be working with you on your process with
Facebook, and cannot wait to have you join our amazing family!
As I spoke about below will be some prep material to help you on
your journey with Facebook’s Technical Screen.

This interview will be 45 minutes long and include 40 minutes of
coding. The most successful individuals look to study by working
with Leetcode, 

   https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/

and looking to build up to 2 Medium to Hard Questions 
in an Hour Period. This will help condition your brain
to the fast pace of the interview. 

Check out what Danil, our World.AI manager has to say about 
his experience in our interview process,

Also come in prepared with why you are interested with joining
Facebook, this will be asked! Engineers and Managers like to see
someone that knows why they would like to join and have done
some research into our environment, projects, etc… 
Your Excitement Can Go A Long Way!!!


Coding Language

We are tech agnostic! – Meaning you can answer the question in
the language you prefer and are most comfortable with.

What the interview will be assessing for;

    Communication: Ask clarifying questions and talk out loud
about your thought process/approach to the problem BEFORE
jumping into the code. This will help the interviewer understand
your problem solving skills and will also help you create a
better solution.

    Speed: Can the engineer we're assessing move fast? It is
very important that you practice coding quickly. Time yourself
when studying!

    Quality: Is the code clean/bug free? If not, it’s okay to
manually fix bugs and optimize the solution. P.S. Make sure you
can go back and test your own code.

Computer Science Fundamentals to Review

Algorithms:

    Merge Sort
    Quick Sort
    Breadth-first Search
    Depth-first Search
    Binary Search

Data Structures:

    Arrays/ArrayLists
    Hash Tables
    Trees
    Graphs
    Stacks/Queues
    Heaps

Concepts:

    Big O
    Recursion

Tips

    Most people study 1-2 weeks and practice on a whiteboard or
coding competition websites beforehand.

    Discuss initial ideas and solutions with your interviewer,
which will help you to clarify any ambiguity.

    Generally avoid solutions with lots of edge cases or huge
if/else if/else blocks. Deciding between iteration and recursion
is always an important step.

    The test will test Data Structures and Algorithm Techniques,
so prepare with the common ones above

    Don’t worry about rote memorization such as runtimes or
API/native calls. It's good to know how to figure out
approximate runtimes on the fly but the code you write is more
important.

    You will be asked about O Memory Constraints on the
complexity of the algorithm you are writing and its running time
– O(N^2) to O(N), etc.
