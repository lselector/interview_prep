# Longest Consecutive Sequence
# 
# Given an unsorted array of integers, 
# find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
# 
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
# 
# Example:
# Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence 
#              is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
# Idea:
#   Make a set of all values
#   If value x is in the set, but value (x-1) is not,
#   then x is a beginning of of a sequence.
#   Then follow it (check if x+1 is in set, etc.)

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        myset = set(nums)
        mymax = 0

        for x in myset:
            if x - 1 not in myset:  # beginning 
                y = x + 1
                while y in myset: # follow the sequence forward
                    y += 1
                mymax = max(mymax, y - x)
        return mymax
